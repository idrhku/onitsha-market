## CONTENTS

## WHAT ARE GIRLS' LOVE TOWARDS BOYS?

Girls love towards boys is only, to eat them and get their needs from them, mostly to get clothes 
and money because with out clothes girls can not be regarded.

Infact, apart from natural beauty of a girls appearance and dressing I can say that all girls are 
one, whether tall or short because they have the same natural body and shape no one with double sex.

There, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, men and women those who are interested in 
love marking and friendship. Don’t love because of cushion chairs and iron beds or wealth. 
For such is not natural love.

There are some ladies and girls who are fond of that by going to a boy or a man’s house 
telling him, I love you there by snatching every penny from him. They like to sit on cushion chairs 
and drink the man’s money, as they are drinking they are demanding shoes and other costly things from 
the person. If the person fails to meet up, they 
run forty-forty, from the person.
